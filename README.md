## 🚀 Project Overview

**Instamart – Revamp** is a front-end redesign project focused on improving the desktop web interface of Swiggy Instamart. The mission was to turn a cluttered, confusing user interface into a clean, modern, and highly functional experience—**all using just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.

This project is a deep dive into UI/UX improvements under strict constraints, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible without frameworks or backend support.

## 🛠 Tech Stack – The Constraint That Became Our Power

I challenged myself by limiting the tech stack to:

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

No libraries. No frameworks. No backend.

This led to three major outcomes:

- 🧠 **Beginner-Friendly:** An excellent playground for budding developers to strengthen core skills.
- 🛠️ **Challenging Simplicity:** Everything from animations to form validation had to be built from the ground up.
- 🧹 **Creative by Necessity:** Without Bootstrap, React, or jQuery, design and interactivity had to be carefully and cleverly crafted.
